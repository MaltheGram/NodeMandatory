            <h2>Variables in JavaScript</h2>
            <span>
                A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.
                To create a variable in JavaScript, we use the let or const keyword.
                The statement below declares a variable with the name “message”:
                const message = "Hello World"
                Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword.
                The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator),
                and it can't be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration).
                However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.

            <h2>Callback Functions</h2>
            <span>
                A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument,
                which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

            <span>Arrow functions is another way to make a function. It <b>can</b> be more compact</span>

                const myArrowFunction = (a, b) => a + b

                }
            </code>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments or super, and should not be used as
                    methods.
                </li>
                <li>Arrow functions don't have access to the new.target keyword.</li>
                <li> Arrow functions aren't suitable for call, apply and bind methods, which generally rely on
                    establishing a scope.
                </li>
                <li>Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.</li>
                <li>Arrow functions cannot use yield, within its body.</li>

            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <span>In JavaScript we have different ways of looping over an iterable. For instance:</span>
            <ul>
                <li><b>For loop</b> <sub><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp" target="_blank">Read
                    more</a></sub></li>
                <li><b>Map</b> → The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of the called upon
                    arrary
                </li>
                <li><b>Filter</b> → The filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered
                    down to
                    just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
                </li>
                <li><b>Reduce</b> → The reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each
                    element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding
                    element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.
                </li>
                <li><b>ForEach</b> → The ForEach() method executes a given function one time for each element in the
                    array
                </li>

            <h2>Importing & Exporting</h2>
            <span>ECMAScript modules are the official format for JavaScript code to be reused.
            In this course the syntax we have used for exporting & importing:
            </span>
            <br>
            <code>
                export const myFunction = () => { /// Execute code }
            </code>
            <br>
            <code>
                import { myFunction } from "/path"
            </code>

            <h2>Type Coercion</h2>
            <span>
                In JavaScript when we want to compare two values, we will use <b>===</b> rather than <b>==</b>.
                 </span>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const price = 12
                    const priceString = "12"
                    const concat = price + priceString

                    result: "1212"
                </code>
            </pre>
            <span>
            You will not necessarily compare a string to a number, and expect this result.
            So if we wanted compare these two values, there's one way we would <b>NOT</b> do it, and one proper way.
            </span>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const price = 12
                    const priceString = "12"
                    const isSame = price == priceString

                    result: true

                    const isSame = price === priceString

                    result: false
                </code>
            </pre>
            <span>
                Moral of the story: Always use === to compare variables and be aware of type coercion.
