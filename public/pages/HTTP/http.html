        <h2> GET Method</h2>
        <p>The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URL. Requests using GET
            should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.
            The server will respond with the given data, often in a JSON format.
            The GET Method is what we call idempotent, which means that if we were to make the same request again,
            the result will be the same.

        <h2>POST Method</h2>
        <p>
            The HTTP POST method sends data to the server. The type of the body of the request is indicated by the
            Content-Type header.

            The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent: calling it once or several times successively
            has the same effect (that is no side effect), where successive identical POST may have additional effects,
            like passing an order several times.


            POST is neither safe nor idempotent. It is therefore recommended for non-idempotent resource requests.
            Making two identical POST requests will most-likely result in two resources containing the same information.

        <h2>PUT Method</h2>
        <p>
            The HTTP PUT request method creates a new resource or replaces a field of the target resource with
            the request payload.
            If the target resource does not have a current representation and the PUT request successfully creates one,
            then the origin server must inform the user agent by sending a 201 (Created) response.
            <br>
            If the target resource does have a current representation and that representation is successfully modified
            in accordance with the state of the enclosed representation, then the origin server will send a 200
            (OK) response to indicate successful completion of the request.

        <h2>PATCH Method</h2>
        <p>The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource.

            A PATCH request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource, vs PUT; which is a complete
            representation of a resource.

            A PATCH is not necessarily idempotent, although it can be. Whereas PUT is always idempotent.
