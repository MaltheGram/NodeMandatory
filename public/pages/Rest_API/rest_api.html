    <p>
        REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a
        variety of ways.

        When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to
        the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is delivered in one of several formats via HTTP:
        JSON (Javascript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is the most generally popular
        file format to use because, despite its name, itâ€™s language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans and
        machines.

        Something else to keep in mind: Headers and parameters are also important in the HTTP methods of a RESTful API
        HTTP request, as they contain important identifier information as to the request's metadata, authorization,
        uniform resource identifier (URI), caching, cookies, and more. There are request headers and response headers,
        each with their own HTTP connection information and status codes.

    <h2>In order for an API to be considered RESTful, it has to conform to these criteria:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A client-server architecture made up of clients, servers, and resources, with requests managed through
            HTTP.
        </li>
        <li>Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client information is stored between get requests and each
            request is separate and unconnected.
        </li>
        <li>Cacheable data that streamlines client-server interactions.</li>
    </ul>
